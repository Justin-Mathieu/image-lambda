# image-lambda

AWS Lab 17

[Link to JSON File](https://lab-17-image-bucket.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/images.json)

## Notes 

- When image is uploaded to bucket lambda function adds image information to JSON file.  
- In this lab I ran into permissions issues and just general confusion about how this works and how to navigate AWS.
